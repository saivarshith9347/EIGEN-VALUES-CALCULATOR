# 🧠 EIGEN Solver

A basic JavaScript utility to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 2x2 and 3x3 matrices. Ideal for learning linear algebra fundamentals and testing matrix calculations.

## ✨ Features
- Calculates eigenvalues for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices
- Simple and educational interface
- No libraries used – just raw JavaScript

## ⚙️ Technologies
- JavaScript
- HTML & CSS

## 🧪 Example
Input:[2, 1] [1, 2]

Output:

Eigenvalues: λ = 1, 3

## 🛤️ Roadmap
- Add support for complex numbers
- Improve UI with React
- Add step-by-step solution explanation
